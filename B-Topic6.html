            <p>Customising information systems is the process of creating a system to satisfy the specific needs and requirements of the business the system will be implemented in. 
                The functionalities will be determined and modified based on business-specific goals and can also includes integration of third-party applications to enhance the capabilities of an already implemented system.
                To customise and information system the requirement of a business needs to be understood and can require a lot of time and cost but allows a business to gain a competitive advantage by optimising their processes.

        <h2>Best Practices for Customization</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Understand the Goal of the System:
                Custom information systems are built from scratch to meet the needs of the business and their unique challenges. A business must analyse these needs and objectives as every decision and feature implemented in the system will be based on and aligned with them.
            </li>
            <li>Adaptability 
                The custom system needs to respond to changes in market condition shifts, technology advancements etc. The system needs to be checked regularly for adjustments and improvements.
            </li>
            <li>User-centred
                The needs of the users of the system need to be prioritized. It is important to understand who the users are, what they need and how they will use the system. Usability-testing and receiving feedback can ensure a positive user experience.
            </li>
            <li>Quality Assurance
                Ensuring that the system meets the need and requirements of the business and finding and fixing bugs falls into this category. All features and functions of the system need to work as they have been intended to. By testing the system at all stages of development can deliver a system that meets or exceeds expectations.
            </li>
            <li>Scalability
                Scalability planning involves creating a system that supports business growth and development and is about future-proofing the system. The custom system should handle adding additional features and modifications, which will avoid costly disruptions in future.
            </li>
            <li>Security
                Security measures must be implemented and continuously updated to stay ahead of potential threats. Encryptions, access controls, authorised access and security audits can aid in this practice. 
            </li>
            <li>Documentation
                Documentation helps anyone understand how the system works and be able to navigate through it and allows knowledge transfer within the organisation
            </li>
            <li>Maintenance
                Regular maintenance of the system is required to ensure that everything is running smoothly. This includes fixing bugs, checking compatibility and security as well as making enhancements based on business needs. By investing in maintenance, the business ensure that the system will add value over time
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h2>Risk and Considerations</h2>
        <p>
         <ul>
            <li>Increased costs: Customising information systems requires addition time and resources and brings and increased cost of maintenance, upgrades, and support</li> 
            
            <li>Reduced flexibility: A custom information system limits the ability to adapt to changing business needs, making it hard to scale over time.</li>
            
            <li>Increased risk: Customisation can introduce risks in the form of bugs and errors that influences its stability and reliability. </li>

            <li>Security: Customisation generally has more security risks than off-the-shelf systems</li>
        </ul>   
        </p>
        <p>By considering the risks that may arise when customising information systems, businesses can work on minimising them and create guidelines to support information system customisation:
            <ul>
                <li>Provide access to proper expertise regarding customisation</li> 
                
                <li>Always carry out risk analysis before customisation.</li>
                
                <li>Evaluate cost and benefits before customisation.</li>
    
                <li>Develop a priority list of customisation requirements.</li>
            </ul>

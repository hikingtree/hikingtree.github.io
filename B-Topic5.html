            <h2>About Information System Integration</h2>

            <p> Businesses operate with several departments with their own processes and operations. By integrating these processes and simplifying the communication between the departments improves the efficiency and productivity of operations.
                Information system integration is the process of combining information and data from across the company into a single accessible location by connecting internal systems and ensuring that they operate together.
            </p>

            <h3>
                Types 

            </h3>
            <p>Legacy system integration:
                Allows for integration of modern applications into existing outdated systems.
                Organisations that rely on outdated software to perform business functions and is still critical to its workflow, benefit from legacy systems being modernised by establish a communication channel with fewer information systems and technology solutions. 
                This allows the organisation to keep existing data and processes.
            </p>
            <p>
            Enterprise application integration:
                Allows for unification of different subsystems inside one business environment.
                Organisations can connect and integrate their business applications and systems within a single network and automates real-time data exchange between different applications. 
            </p>
            <p>
            Third-party system integration:
                Allows expanding functionality of the existing system.
                When an organisation needs new functionality but cannot afford custom software or does not have time to build from scratch, the use of third-party tools can be used.
            </p>
            <p>
            Business-to-business integration:
                Allows for connecting systems of two or more organizations.
                Automates transactions across companies, leading to more efficient cooperation and trade between businesses.

            <h3>Benefits and Challenges</h3>

            <p>Benefits:
            <ul>
                <li>Productivity –  integrated systems complete tasks more efficiently and allows for centralized control over processes so more work gets done in less time.</li> 
                
                <li>Data accuracy – data is updated across the system simultaneously, so all departments are on the same page.</li>
                
                <li>Faster decision-making – all data is in a centralized, so it is easier to extract significant information and make decisions quickly.</li>
            </ul>
                
            </p>
            <p>
                Challenges: 
                <ul>
                    <li>Complexity – integration only ties systems together, so programs still need to be upgraded separately and takes a long time.</li> 
                    
                    <li>Data accuracy – data is updated across the system simultaneously, so all departments are on the same page.</li>
                    
                    <li>Faster decision-making – all data is in a centralized, so it is easier to extract significant information and make decisions quickly.</li>

                    <li>Cost – initial cost of system integration is expensive to implement and requires a large investment.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            
            <h3>Integration Strategies</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Applications programming interfaces (API):
                        One of the easiest and fastest ways to connect systems by providing a layer between applications and creating a common language for applications to communicate. 
                        They enable transmission of data functionality in a standardised format.
                    </li> 
                    
                    <li> 
                        Middleware:
                        A hidden software layer that connects distributed systems, applications, services, and devices and handles a variety of tasks.
                    </li>
                    
                    <li>Webhooks:
                        Link applications through event-based solutions and provides real-time information but cannot send complex information.
                        Real-time messages are sent by one system to another when a certain event occurs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Electronic data interchange (EDI):
                        Exchanges business information in a standard electronic format and replacing paper documents.
                        Can happen via a value-added network where a third-party network is in charge of data transmission, or direct connections through the internet
                    </li>

            <h3>Steps to Implement System Integration</h3>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Planning
                        Understanding the requirements of the system and which systems must be integrated is the first step. With this, determining its operational feasibility is important to figure out what is possible and what is not and finding the best solutions.                        
                    </li> 
                    
                    <li> 
                        Architecture Modelling
                        A blueprint of the system integration is created, showing the different systems and the exchange of information between them. A solid design can ensure data connectivity between all components and performs efficient integration.
                    </li> 
                    <li>Implementation
                        In this step the blueprint is made into reality and the integration is performed. Once the system is ready it undergoes operational testing to verify that the system flows effectively. 
                        Familiarity of the system is also included in this step.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Maintenance
                        The final step involves ensuring that the design work properly and that there are no bugs.
                        Components and features can be modified and updated to meet new needs and keep up with technological advancements as time goes on. 
                    </li>
                </ul>

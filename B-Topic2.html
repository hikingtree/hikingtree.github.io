                <h2>About Information Quality:</h2>

                <h3>What is data and information?</h3>
                <p>In a business context, information refers to data (raw, independent facts) that has been organized and subsequently processed in such a way that it provides meaning to the person or system that will use it with the intent of furthering objectives and goals.</p>

                <h3>What is the difference between data and information quality?</h3>
                <p>Since data is a collection of raw, independent facts, data quality is the measure of the state of the data. In other words, the extent to which the data conforms to the rules that the type of data is associated with. </p>
                <p>Information quality refers to the degree to which information contributes to a value adding business process with high quality information providing the grounds for good business decisions, whilst lower quality information can lead to bad decisions along with time and resource wasting.</p>
                <p>Data and information quality can be determined by examining a few key factors. </p>

                <h3>Key Points (criteria):</h3>
                <h4>Accuracy:</h4>
                <p>The difference between the value of the data being used to produce information and the value of data considered to be perfect and would produce perfect information. Data can be considered accurate if the values are sufficiently close to perfect.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p> An ecommerce company that ships more, or less product then ordered by a consumer could be considered to possess inaccurate sales data.</p>

                <h4>Correctness:</h4>
                <p>Information derived from proper data values that have undergone proper processing. Most often attributed to human error, the use of techniques such as data validation as well as source data automation devices (automatic data entry) can mitigate incorrect data.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>The use of barcode scanners in supermarkets or RFID tags and readers in passports sufficiently and consistently produce and use correct data relevant to the industry.</p>

                <h4>Precision:</h4>
                <p>The smallest degree to which a data element is to be store in a computer to presented to users.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Income tax of 7% on R95674.89 results in R6697.2423 of taxed income. Of course, it is not possible to pay 24.23 cents. Therefore, the number is rounded down to R6697.24 of taxed income.</p>

                <h4>Consistency:</h4>
                <p>All the data elements being processed into information are based on the same assumptions.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>In the case of an employee termination in the sales department of a business, inconsistent data between sales and finance departments could result in that employee still being on company pay-roll even after dismissal.</p>

                <h4>Conformity:</h4>
                <p>The extent to which the information being gathered conforms to the needs and expectations of who/what will use it.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>International companies may plan meetings in which participants may speak different languages. Presenting information to an audience such as this in a single language can limit or entirely negate certain participants understanding of the information.</p>

                <h4>Completeness:</h4>
                <p>Refers to information that is based on all factors relevant to its purpose.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>An international ecommerce business may request a customer provide their addressing details; country, state/province, city, suburb, street/road, and Post code. Without the correct  validation systems in place, addressing information provided by a customer may accidentally negate a crucial part of the overall address. Unchecked, the incomplete information would result in products not being shipped correctly costing time and resources.</p>

                <h4>Relevance:</h4>
                <p>Begs the question of whether the information being produced serves the business in some way or not. Useless information outside of the scope of a business wastes time and resources.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>An information system that analyses and processes employee productivity should not require employees to provide their home addresses or contact details.</p>

                <h4>Timeliness:</h4>
                <p>The relationship between when information is needed, becomes available to use, and when underlying data was procured. It is crucial that information reflects up-to-date data. Since information loses value over time, having information available when it is needed is of utmost importance. </p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>In a hospital, securing patients medical history in a timely manner is a key component to preventing further pain or in some cases death as it ensures consideration of any unknown health factors that may prevent the use of certain medications or medical techniques.</p>

                <h4>Cost:</h4>
                <p>When it comes to information quality, cost of information refers to whether an information system produces information that is more beneficial than it is costly.</p>
                <p>Example:</p>
                <p>Costs for an information system can be a result of; Planning and analysis, hardware and software costs, employee training time, overall development, and implementation costs. These factors vary depending on industry and scale.</p>

                <h3>Evaluating Information quality:</h3>
                <p>When it comes to evaluating whether the quality of information being produced is sufficient for its intended use, it is important to consider and ask pertaining questions about each of the criteria that make up data and information quality.</p>
